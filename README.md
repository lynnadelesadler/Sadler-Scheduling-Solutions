## Usage

<!-- Provide a list of steps on how to use the work day scheduler -->

- When a user opens the Work Day Scheduler the current date and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.

  - The date and time will continuously update on an open webpage.

- Timeblocks for standard 9am to 5pm business hours are available to document appointments and tasks.

- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

  - Grey represents the past.
  - Red represents the current hour timeblock.
  - Green represents the future.

- When a user clicks into a timeblock they can enter text to document an appointment or task.
  - A user should click the save icon located within the timeblock row to save the appointment/task typed into the timeblock.
  - When the save button is clicked a message will appear in the top header.
